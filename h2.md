## The widely acclaimed white paper "Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains" by Eric M. Hutchins∗, Michael J. Cloppert†, Rohan M. Amin, Ph.D.‡ in Lockheed Martin Corporation describes the idea of applying the kill chain model into intrusion detection. 

The model defines the following stages of of cyber attacks: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, Command and Control, actions on objectives.

The white paper defines Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) as sophisticated, systematic cyber attack campaigns that are typically conducted by nation-states or state-sponsored groups. The framework can be used to analyze APTs by breaking down their complex attacks into manageable stages, which can then be targeted with specific defensive measures.

I work in IT industry as an engineer and from my perspective the topics included in this white paper are more relevant than ever during my career. The APT is the most dangerous adversary since every system is possible to breach and you can even think the situation in a way that as the time moves forward, the APT will surely find a way to get in to the organization at some point. And as these adversaries are state backed or sponsored the resources on time can be limitless and these campaigns can take years and operate in real life relying on social engineering and human error and also on technical level trying to leverage misconfigurations in the target organisations systems.
