## The widely acclaimed white paper "Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains" by Eric M. Hutchins∗, Michael J. Cloppert†, Rohan M. Amin, Ph.D.‡ in Lockheed Martin Corporation describes the idea of applying the kill chain model into intrusion detection. 

The model defines the following stages of of cyber attacks: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, Command and Control, actions on objectives.

The white paper defines Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) as sophisticated, systematic cyber attack campaigns that are typically conducted by nation-states or state-sponsored groups. The framework can be used to analyze APTs by breaking down their complex attacks into manageable stages, which can then be targeted with specific defensive measures.

I work in IT industry as an engineer and from my perspective the topics included in this white paper are more relevant than ever during my career. The APT is the most dangerous adversary since every system is possible to breach and you can even think the situation in a way that as the time moves forward, the APT will surely find a way to get in to the organization at some point. And as these adversaries are state backed or sponsored the resources on time can be limitless and these campaigns can take years and operate in real life relying on social engineering and human error and also on technical level trying to leverage misconfigurations in the target organisations systems. 

The Cyber Kill Chain works as a model when you're trying to define the attack surface of the target organisation and when you are planning the security controls. Understanding the different stages helps in adopting the defence in depth and mitigating risks involved every stage is necessary when defending against the most impactful adversaries. 

## Shostack 2014: Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model presents the idea that Threat Modelling is a skill that everyone can learn and apply in their lives. It simplifies the idea of 'Threat Modelling' into something that's "about using models to find security problems".

It also presents tools such as diagrams and card games as tools to asses risks and to communicate what you are building. To Threat Model your own you can follow these easy steps by the book:

1. Draw a diagram.
2. Use the EoP game to find threats.
3. Address each threat in some way.
4. Check your work with the checklists at the end of this chapter.
5. Celebrate and share your work.

I think threat modelling is a great way for technical personnel and developers to implement "shift-left" type of culture where risks related to technical aspects happen in the early planning stage of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) or DevOps cycle. It's still very common in many organisations IT operations that security is something that's considered as an afterthought and assessed by audits in existin environments. Tilting the security matters to the beginning of the life cycle doesn't exclude the need for these kind of assessments as security is something that mature organisations embed into every stage of the lifecycle. However, doing a profound threat modelling and recognizing risks and needs for technical security controls makes it possible to address these flaws before they are deployed and therefore reducing the security risks significantly. 

## Karvinen 2023: Install Debian on Virtualbox is a very easy to understand and user friendly guide on how you can install Debian on VirtualBox, so you can run Linux on your machine regardless of the host os. 

This manual contains lots of screenshots and explains everything in detail in a way that by following the guide you will understand each step profoundly. 

It's great that even utilizing the firewall has been included in this tutorial along with strong emphasis on good password hygiene!

In my current line of work in public cloud technologies installing a Linux on VM like this is a little bit old fashioned. When building cloud native applications the direction is to use more modern virtualization and containerization technologies.

## Due the holistic nature of security, there are several ways to approach the topic and many ways to consider which theoretical foundation to prioritize. For a person who considers security from legal perspective GDPR, NIS2 or other standards or legal requirements will matter more than to a technical person who would be more intersted in how to implement Zero Trust networks, IAM policies according to the principle of least privilege or how to secure the organizations web apps from OWASP10 threats.
