## Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 2 - Protocol Building Blocks: subchapters "2.3 One-way Fuctions" and "2.4 One-Way Hash Functions".

- According to the chapter 2.3 One-way Functions (Schneier, 2015) the one way functions are very easy to compute, but very hard to reverse. 
- One-way function is central to public-key cryptography.
- A message encrypted with the one-way function isn't useful as no one could decrypt it
- A trapdoor one-way function is a function that is easy to compute in one direction and hard to compute in the other direction.
- This read was interesting in a way that I have several use cases behind where hash functions have been used (related to data integrity, passwords & certificates), but without knowledge of the concepts of “trapdoor one-way function”, “one-way functions” or their differences. 

## Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat

- The article describes in detail how to use hashcat tool for cracking passwords.
- It came to me as a new thing that you can use “hashid -m” command to identify hash type. I’m not professionally inclined in a way that cracking hashes would be a normal job for me (even though hashcat is a familiar tool and I have used it before to some extent) so this kind of detail was a nice new thing to know.
- There’s also tip that you can boost hashcats performance with running it on your host OS and utilizing your display adapter for it.

## Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited

- This article goes through the basics when working with command line and working and moving between directories, file manipulation etc.
- The article is a comprehensive cheat sheet for anyone to educate (or re-educate, when you’re working in those legacy servers in production you really REALLY want to get the commands right) themselves on command line basics.
