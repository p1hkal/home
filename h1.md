# h1 - HelSec presentation

## On 26th of October Elias Alanko, a finance industry veteran from 3stepIT gave a presentation about BEC (Business Email Compromise). Even though having the word 'email' as a part of the title, this is actually an umbrella term in corporate fraud schemes and is misleading in a way that no compromised emails are needed in some of the fraud schemes that go into this category.

The concept of CEO fraud was presented - the classic way of advisories to leverage the sense of urgency and a request from a high authority in order to social engineer people to change target bank account numbers, make transactions into wrong accounts or giving out classified information and falling into a phishing trap. These campaigns and phishing emails can be targeted into employees private email accounts so corporate security controls, such as email filters and other security policies won't have any effect or visibility on them. Along with the invoice fraud type where the advisory requests changes to invoice informations to control the money traffic into wrong accounts these kind of campaigns rely on psychological side of the victims relying on the high authority, sense of urgency and on the fact that people are prone to help. 

From my over four year experience as IT consultant in large consultancy companies such as Accenture, PwC and IBM these themes are familiar from internal trainings. These trainings have been facilitated in every company I've worked in and as security mitigations should be done in ever evolving landscape there has been a rerun usually in every six months. Also I have first hand experience of being a target of a CEO fraud. These attempts have been almost frequent at times and as it was said during the presentation, they have sometimes been sent into private emails. 

I think it's important that companies acknowledge the risks that also come from the private life. The geopolitical threats that emerge locally should influence the decision making when planning internal security controls and education of employees. As an example in a case of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) which means an advesary that has long term focus on their target, the threat might very likely come from freetime activities outside of working hours. The emphasis should be on the narrative that the company workers, especially when working with critical infrastructure or in positions where they have access to business critical data, are at risk all the time. From my experience this has actually mostly been the way of handling this topics in the companies I've worked at. Still it makes you wonder if theres larger need to educate people to recognize the risks that come from their civil life.
